This all began with the frustration from presets often falling short for the diverse range of images we were shooting, so over lockdown @zackkalter fell into what can only be described as an editing blackhole, to revisit an idea he had in 2018. Thousands of hours later he emerged triumphant with not only vast knowledge of color science, the dynamics of lighting and grading, and a proficiency in Lightroom that not even Adobe employees possess - but also a way to combine two powerful editing tools to create something entirely new. Something we‚Äôve been testing and tweaking all year, and something we are coining a ‚Äúproset‚Äù. And after much refinement, we are ready to share our tools with you! Our First Edition Collection is available now! Because this system was specifically built around our workflow, it works it‚Äôs magic best on the way we shoot and edit.
